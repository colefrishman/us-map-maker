# U.S. Map Maker

Make maps quickly! Just click on any state to give it color. Or, import a CSV with the relevant data.

There are customization options below the Map itself.

Then just save it as an SVG!

The background color can take color names (white, red, lightblue etc.) or hex values (#ffffff, #ff0000, etc.)

An example CSV file is included in the root directory
